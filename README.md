# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Node.js Asynchronous File Operation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js asynchronous programming: unhandled promise rejections. The code attempts to read a file asynchronously and then performs another asynchronous operation.  If the second operation fails, the promise rejection is not handled, leading to potential application instability.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code uses promises and `async/await` to read a file and perform a subsequent asynchronous operation. If the second operation fails, the promise rejection is not handled properly. This is a silent error which can cause unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Solution
The solution involves adding proper error handling for the second asynchronous operation within the `try...catch` block to capture any rejections from asynchronous operations.
